// And what we're gonna do is to basically create a small web server, 
// and then actually listen to the event that it emits

const server = http.createServer();

//if you see .on anywhere in a node project,well, 
//then you already know that you are listening, or that the code is listening for an event
server.on('request', (req, res) => {
    console.log('Request Received!');
    console.log(req.url);
    res.end('Request Received!');
});
server.on('request', (req, res) => {
    console.log('Another request Received!ðŸ˜­');
});
//We can also listen to the close event.
server.on('close', () => {
    console.log('Server closed!ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘ˆ')
});
//We start the server up by using server.listen, pass in the port, 
//the address which is localhost again
server.listen(8000, '127.0.0.1', () => {
    console.log('Waiting for the request...');
